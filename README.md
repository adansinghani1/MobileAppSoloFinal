Project Summary
Our group is creating an Inventory Management app in Java. The goal of the project is to have an application where a business could track and manage their inventory efficiently and have everything conveniently located in one place. An administrator user will be put in place who can manage the inventory and manipulate items when needed. There will be users without the same administrative rights which are used for employees to track inventory. The purpose of this is for security and to make sure the employee is not able to fabricate or falsify the inventory. The plan is to get rid of manually tracking inventory and being able to track it all through an application. We will have a feature where you can scan each barcode and it will fill in the information of the product using the UPC barcode.
